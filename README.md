#  NasaPics

We'll progressively build a small SwiftUI app that displays the NASA photo of the day. Each installment (commit, post, video) will be broken down into the smallest piece of work that I can imagine at the time. This repo will be the most concise part of the series as the videos will be strictly one take each.
